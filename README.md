Designed with [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) after attending a [Vancouver Hackspace](http://vancouver.hackspace.ca/) workshop. This design has been created specifically to be laser cut on to a plank of wood. More information about this project can be found on my personal website [abluestar.com](http://www.abluestar.com/blog/lasers-and-vancouver-opendata/)
